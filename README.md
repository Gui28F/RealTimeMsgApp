# RealTimeMsgApp
 
This repository contains both the backend and frontend components of a simple real-time chat application. The backend is developed using Spring Boot with RESTful APIs and Websockets, while the frontend is built with React. The application serves as a learning resource and a foundation for building real-time chat systems.
